# Contributions

We work by submitting and then merging Pull Requests (PRs). Every PR must address an open Issue. 

When creating a branch to work on an issue, create a new branch with the following name: `<descriptive-title>-#<issue-number>`. For example: `input-class-#5`, `point-math-#7`, etc.

Every commit must start with one of the following:

- `feat:` if a new feature was added
- `fix:` if a bug was fixed
- `doc:` if documentation was added
- `refactor:` if code was restructured/renamed
- `wip:` if unfinished work has to be commited temporarily (discouraged, consider squashing the commits afterward)
